versioncontrol 6.x-2.x
======================
- Add a 'data' field to the labels tabel, so that backends can more easily
  plug in additional data on their labels.
- Introduced 'single backend mode' $conf flag, a global flag indicating
  whether or not multiple backends are enabled. Useful because single backend
  mode allows streamlined querying and operations.
- Created a repository multiple loader function, fashioned after similar such
  entity multiloaders in D7.
- Introduced dependency on autoload, both for future dbtng dependency and to
  assist with managing all the classes in the vcsapi system itself.
- Major rewrite of the 1.x branch in OOP.
