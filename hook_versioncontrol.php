/**
 * Act on database changes when commits are inserted or deleted.
 * Note that this hook is not necessarily called at the time when the commit
 * actually happens - commits can also be inserted by a cron script when
 * the actual commit has been accomplished for quite a while already.
 *
 * @param $op
 *   'insert' when the commit has just been recorded and inserted into the
 *   database, or 'delete' if it will be deleted right after this hook
 *   has been called.
 *
 * @param $commit
 *   A commit array containing basic information about a commit.
 *   It consists of the following elements:
 *
 *   - 'commit_id': The Drupal-specific commit identifier (a simple integer)
 *        which is unique among all commits in all repositories.
 *   - 'repository': The repository where this commit occurred.
 *        This is a structured array, like a single element of
 *        what is returned by versioncontrol_get_repositories().
 *   - 'date': The time when the revision was committed,
 *        given as Unix timestamp.
 *   - 'uid': The Drupal user id of the committer, or 0 if no Drupal user
 *        could be associated to the committer.
 *   - 'username': The system specific VCS username of the committer.
 *   - 'directory': The deepest-level directory in the repository that is
 *        common to all the changed items, e.g. '/src' if the commit changed
 *        the files '/src/subdir/code.php' and '/src/README.txt'.
 *   - 'message': The commit message.
 *   - 'revision': The VCS specific repository-wide revision identifier,
 *        like '' in CVS, '27491' in Subversion or some SHA-1 key in various
 *        distributed version control systems. If there is no such revision
 *        (which may be the case for version control systems that don't support
 *        atomic commits) then the 'revision' element is an empty string.
 *   - '[xxx]_specific': An array of VCS specific additional commit information.
 *        How this array looks like is defined by the corresponding
 *        backend module (versioncontrol_[xxx]).
 *
 * @param $commit_actions
 *   A structured array containing the exact details of what happened to
 *   each item in this commit. Array keys are the current/new paths, also for
 *   VERSIONCONTROL_ACTION_DELETED actions even if the file actually doesn't
 *   exist anymore. The corresponding array values are again structured arrays
 *   and consist of elements with the following keys:
 *
 *   - 'action': Specifies how the item was modified.
 *        One of the predefined VERSIONCONTROL_ACTION_* values.
 *   - 'modified': Boolean value, specifies if a file was modified in addition
 *        to the other action in the 'action' element of the array.
 *        Only exists for the VERSIONCONTROL_ACTION_MOVED
 *        and VERSIONCONTROL_ACTION_COPIED actions.
 *   - 'current item': The updated state of the modified item.
 *        Exists for all actions except VERSIONCONTROL_ACTION_DELETED.
 *   - 'source items': An array with the previous state(s) of the modified item.
 *        Path and branch will always be the same as in the current item
 *        except for the VERSIONCONTROL_ACTION_MOVED,
 *        VERSIONCONTROL_ACTION_COPIED and VERSIONCONTROL_ACTION_MERGED actions.
 *        Exists for all actions except VERSIONCONTROL_ACTION_ADDED.
 *
 *   Item values are structured arrays and consist of elements
 *   with the following keys:
 *
 *   - 'type': Specifies the item type, which is either
 *        VERSIONCONTROL_ITEM_FILE or VERSIONCONTROL_ITEM_DIRECTORY.
 *   - 'path': The path of the item at the specific revision.
 *   - 'revision': The (file-level) revision when the item was changed.
 *        If there is no such revision (which may be the case for
 *        directory items) then the 'revision' element is an empty string.
 *   - '[xxx]_specific': May be set by the backend to remember additional
 *        item info. ("[xxx]" is the unique string identifier of the respective
 *        version control system.)
